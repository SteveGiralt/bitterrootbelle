            Born and raised in the Bitterroot Valley, I have always been in love
            with nature and art. My dad taught me the value of hard work and to
            always create something that I could be proud of. Bitterroot Belle
            was an idea that started in 2014 when I made some homemade gifts for
            friends and family for Christmas. What began as a way to save a few
            dollars at the holidays expanded to a few crafts on my coffee table,
            then a few more, and a few more. Today I produce high-quality,
            handmade gifts for you and your loved ones to enjoy. Everything is
            made by hand, by me, and I know you will love it as much as I do.

          All of these beautiful cutting boards are hand-crafted solid wood.
          They are constructed from quality materials, and not only will they
          look great in your kitchen - they will hold up to daily use. Wood
          species used varies by board including African mahogany, cherry,
          hickory, and others. Each is oiled with high-quality food safe mineral
          oil and beeswax.

        <p>
          Oiled wood not only looks beautiful, but its surface can be restored
          by applying new coats of protecive oil. My homemade board butter is
          just what you need to keep your board beautiful and the wood properly
          conditioned. Made with natural beeswax and mineral oil, it doesn't
          contain any artificial scents or dyes and is food safe and
          hypoallergenic.
