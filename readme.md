My wife is a woodworker and needed a very simple landing page for her business.

This is my first project based on Bootstrap - but I didn't want it to look too.. "bootstrappy".

It's fast, it's pretty, it's mobile-first responsive design, and it's accessible.

This site is currently live at http://www.bitterrootbelle.com - as soon as changes are pushed to Github they are automatically send to Netlify where they're built on the fly.
